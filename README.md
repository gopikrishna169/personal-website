# Personal Portfolio

Code for my personal portfolio [website](http://claire-huang.com) so I can remember my favorite projects and other miscellaneous endeavors. Two redesigns later, I'm happy with it for the time being! Scrolling panels enabled by [fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js). Made with HTML, Sass, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sketch 3, and pixel goodness.
